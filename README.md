This is my final year dissertation submission, discussing the benefits and limitations of using Jupyter Notebook as a tool for co-design.
The COTADS team conducted co-design workshops with Type 1 diabetics (non-experts in Machine Learning) to educate them on ML principles, and discuss how ML could be designed to support the condition of diabetes.
I then conducted follow-up individual interviews with the participants to gather research on our usage of Jupyter Notebook within the co-design sessions.
